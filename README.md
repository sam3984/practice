Just to use same repo I have uploaded in hury for your review. 
1.) virtual camera application go inside it -- mvn clean install 
2.) virtual-camera-server go inside it -- mvn clean install 
3.) Just import the #1 and #2 in eclipse
4.) Start the server from eclipse
5.) Start the app from eclipse
6.) Use hosted swagger  http://localhost:8443/swagger-ui.html#/ to hit getLogs API

You can verify from api output and camera app logs as soon as you hit get logs you will get actual generated logs from App
